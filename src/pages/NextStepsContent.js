      Antidepressants work by influencing the production and function of
      neurotransmitters in the brain. Of the antidepressants, the most commonly
      used for PPD are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic
      antidepressants (TCAs).
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision of whether or not to pursue medications as a treatment method
      for PPD is a challenging one. There are many risks that vary in severity
      that come with taking antidepressants during lactation (breastfeeding).
      While some medications are less harmful than others, almost all types of
      antidepressants make their way into the breastmilk, which in turn can have
      short term and long-term consequences of the neurodevelopment of the
      infant.

      The most common type of medications for the treatment of anxiety are
      antidepressants. Antidepressants work by influencing the production and
      function of neurotransmitters in the brain. Of the antidepressants, the
      most commonly used for PPA are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

      are the most commonly prescribed medications.

    <p>
      Anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed as well. They help induce a
      calming effect in the body. They are usually prescribed for a short period
      of treatment as tolerance for the medication rapidly develops and
      withdrawal symptoms post-use are common.{" "}
